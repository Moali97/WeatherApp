# Weather App

This is a weather app I created with Django, HTML, CSS and bootstrap.

<h2>What it taught me</h2>
I was able to learn how to use the requests library to get information from a webiste with the help of an application programming interface (API). I was also introduced to forms which I used to allow user to search for a city that they wish to know the weather of.

<h2>Future features</h2>  
- I want to allow the app to show the weather in the next few days instead of the current time.
